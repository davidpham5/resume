          ten principles for good design
        </a> read less like an aesthetic framework and more like an ethical one. Good design is
        honest — it doesn't try to be more than it is. I come back to his principles whenever a
        problem starts piling on complexity it doesn't need.

        </a> showed me that typography is never decoration — it's the first signal of whether you
        respect your reader's time. His attention to how words sit on a page changed how I think
        about every interface I work on.

          Jen Simmons
        </a> has been doing some of the most important work in web standards and CSS layout for
        years. She makes the case that the web can be expressive and structurally sound at the same
        time. A personal hero.

        My <a href="/resume" class="text-green-500">resume</a> is built as an Astro app — something
        as simple as a resume felt like the right place to try and get the type and engineering both
        right. When you're done looking around, let's get some coffee.
