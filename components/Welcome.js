            I'm David Pham. I'm a frontend developer and designer in Washington DC. I taught myself how to program and build interfaces. And I love coffee from an AeroPress.

            <span className="drop">M</span>y design sensibilities are heavily influenced by several people. I often revisit the work of Dieter Rams, and his <Link href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design"><a className="text-green-500" target="_blank">ten principles for good design</a></Link>. His principles are something I continue to study over and over whenever I run into a tough challenge.

          <p className="mt-4 leading-normal text-lg">
            I really admire <Link href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/about/"><a className="text-green-500" target="_blank">Jason Santa Maria</a></Link> and his hard work around typography. He really inspired me in making the web more beautiful.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-normal text-lg">
            I closely follow the work of <Link href="http://www.jensimmons.com/"><a target="_blank" className="text-green-500">Jen Simmons</a></Link>. Her work in web standards, CSS Grid, and typography has significantly impacted me. She's a personal hero of mine.

            I've put together my <Link href="/"><a className="text-green-500">resume</a></Link> as an React & NextJS app. It illustrates something as simple as a resume can be done with great type and engineering. When you're done looking around, lets get some coffee and talk shop.
